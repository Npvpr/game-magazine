        <div class="intro">My website is about games.</div>
        <div class="inspire">I have always loved playing games. Therefore, magazine about games would be the most suitable for my website. These games I have shown are my recent favourite games so they inspired me a lot.</div>
        <div class="access">I gave my variables names as specific and clear as possible. I also used so many gifs and photos.</div>
        <div class="use">People can look at my website and get inspired to play these games. They can also learn more about these games in their specific pages. For example, what their gameplays look like.</div>
        <div class="learn">I learned quite a lot. Specifically, how to use grids, you can't use video as background so you need to be creative, you need to combine z-index, object-fit and others to achieve that, you can't target CSS's pseudo-classes from Javascript so you need to work around, and so much more.</div>
        <div class="eval1">My Javascript codes are quite amazing I think. I tried my best to make it as "DRY" as possible so they are flexible.</div>
        <div class="eval2">If I have more time, I would like to add more contents and improve my CSS for responsiveness. I am not quite good with that.</div>
        <div class="resource">I downloaded game contents from the official websites and I also inspect their source code for reference. I read MDN documentation.</div>
        <div class="wire">I planned my wireframes on my book because doing wireframes on computer is quite tedious and hard for me. So I can't show you my wireframes but I can show responsive designs for each pages.</div>
